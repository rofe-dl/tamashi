A discord bot that can follow what a Spotify user is listening to and play it in a voice channel so everyone can listen in simultaneously. Although this feature already exists in Discord with the Spotify integration (Listen Along), only premium Spotify users get to use it. This bot can be a viable alternative.

Apart from that, it also supports manually playing songs with the `/play` command.

## How do I set this up? (incomplete)

docker run --name my-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
java -jar Lavalink.jar
npm run deploycommands
white list users in Spotify dashboard

//dev
./ngrok authtoken {your-auth-token}
./ngrok http 8080

lavalink
redis
ngrok
express server
mongodb
node
discord.js

## Future plans

1. Make a docker image
1. Show lyrics of a song
1. Buttons for all common commands
1. Rate limiting on Spotify Bot API
1. Queue feature
