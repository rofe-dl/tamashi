# Node Setup Instructions

- If on Linux, I'd recommend using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage versions easily. I used Node v16 for this project.

- Open this codebase in the terminal and run `npm i`.

- Make a file called `config.env` in this folder and copy the contents of `sample.config.env` into it and replace the values with your own.
