# Lavalink Setup Instructions

- [Download Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink)
- Head on over there and download `Lavalink.jar` from the latest release. Make sure you have Java 11 or above installed & added to the path.
- Make a file called `application.yml` in the same folder you kept the JAR file in.
- Copy the contents of the `sample.lavalink.application.yml` into this new file and fill it with your own config info where I tagged `#INPUT`.
- To run this server, open the terminal in this folder and run the command `java -jar Lavalink.jar`.
